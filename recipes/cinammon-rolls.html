            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>A cinnamon roll is a sweet baked dough filled with a cinnamon-sugar filling. Made with a rich dough
                leavened with yeast, their characteristic form is due to rolling a dough sheet containing sweetened
                cinnamon filling. Common toppings for cinnamon rolls include cream cheese frosting or a sugar glaze.</p>
