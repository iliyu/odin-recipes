            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>A cinnamon roll is a sweet baked dough filled with a cinnamon-sugar filling. Made with a rich dough
                leavened with yeast, their characteristic form is due to rolling a dough sheet containing sweetened
                cinnamon filling. Common toppings for cinnamon rolls include cream cheese frosting or a sugar glaze.</p>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Place ingredients in the pan of the bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer.
                    Select dough cycle; press start.</li>
                <li>After the dough has doubled in size turn it out onto a lightly floured surface, cover and let rest
                    for 10 minutes. In a small bowl, combine brown sugar and cinnamon.</li>
                <li>Roll dough into a 16x21-inch rectangle. Spread dough with 1/3 cup butter and sprinkle evenly with
                    sugar/cinnamon mixture. Roll up dough and cut into 12 rolls. Place rolls in a lightly greased 9x13
                    inch baking pan. Cover and let rise until nearly doubled, about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven
                    to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Bake rolls in preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes. While rolls are baking, beat
                    together cream cheese, 1/4 cup butter, confectioners' sugar, vanilla extract and salt. Spread
                    frosting on warm rolls before serving.</li>
